# Anvil Test Case Specification with Jest

This document describes the structure and usage of our Jest test cases for Anvil API testing. The test framework follows a consistent pattern for validating API responses, focusing on both positive and negative test scenarios.

## Test Case Structure
Each test case is defined as a JavaScript object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    name: 'Descriptive Test Case Name',
    variables: {
        payload: {
            // API request payload
        }
    },
    expectedIncludes: [
        // Array of strings/documents-names that MUST appear in response
    ],
    expectedExcludes: [
        // Array of strings/documents-names that MUST NOT appear in response
    ]
}

```
